### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2020

+ Projec title: Word frequency changes over time
+ This project is conducted by Xiyao Yan

+ Project summary: This project focus on the change of word frquency used in lyrics along with time. After counting the word frquency of every word per decade, top 18 words are chosen. When having a closer look of the chosen words, a cycle of frquency can be detected. In addition, the period and range of this cycle may differ from word to word.
